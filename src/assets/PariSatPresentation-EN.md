At the end of 2021, **GAREF** responded to an opportunity to participate in an **ESA** (European Space Agency) project to carry a small payload on the inaugural launch of **Ariane 6**, the new European launcher. On February 4, 2022, **GAREF** received the confirmation that its **PariSat** experiment had been accepted as part of the payload on the first **Ariane 6** launch (referenced **VA262**), which took off from **Kourou** at the **Guiana Space Center** on Tuesday, July 9, 2024, at 19:00 UTC.
&NewLine;This was an exceptional opportunity for **GAREF**, which has carried out numerous experiments since its creation in **1964**, including five experimental rocket launches in **Kourou** and three in **Kiruna** (as part of the **CNES PERSEUS** project). In 1981, its first satellite, **Thésée**, was launched on the 4th Ariane test flight (L04).
&NewLine;After three years of work, **PariSat** was a unique opportunity to put a new experiment into orbit and marked the club's first opportunity to take photos from space. **PariSat** is characterized above all by the fact that it was entirely designed and built in-house at **GAREF** by young enthusiasts aged 15 to 25, from the overall mechanical architecture to board soldering, including electronic design and software development.
